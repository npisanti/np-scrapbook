np-scrapbook
=====================================
scrapbook for my creative coding visual scripts, both GLSL fragment shaders and lua scripts, you need [pixelscript](https://github.com/npisanti/np-pixelscript) to run them.

memo to make gifs:
```console
    mogrify -background black -alpha off *
    convert -delay 6 -loop 0 -dispose 2 *.png output.gif
```

The code in this repository will change as the water flows, don't be attached to it =)
